# File Explorer UI

![File Explorer UI.](/UIIMAGE.png)

Building a **JSON structure** for a **File Explorer UI** involves considering various aspects such as folders, files, hierarchy, and metadata. 

 **A hierarchical representation** where each folder can contain **sub-folders and files**. Feel free to modify and expand the structure based on your specific needs, including additional metadata or properties for each file or folder. **The Key** is to maintain the hierarchical relationship in the **"children"** property.
